express-backbone-sample
=======================

A sample application demonstrating express, backbone, and mongo.
The application was modified from Christopher Buecheler's tutorial "CREATING A SIMPLE RESTFUL WEB APP WITH NODE.JS, EXPRESS, AND MONGODB"[http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb], I only modified the frontend to add backbonejs to it as a sample.
